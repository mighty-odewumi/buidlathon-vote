UniPoll: Secure and Transparent Elections Powered by Blockchain

UniPoll is a revolutionary web application designed to enhance the security and transparency of elections. By leveraging blockchain technology, UniPoll safeguards against electoral malpractices such as rigging and reduces the incidence of voting violations.

Key Advantages of UniPoll:

-   Enhanced Security: Blockchain technology provides a tamper-proof record of votes, making rigging or manipulation virtually impossible. Every vote is immutably stored and verifiable, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.
-   Increased Transparency: UniPoll fosters transparency by providing auditable results. All stakeholders can access and verify the election outcome, fostering trust and confidence in the system.
-   Reduced Violations: The immutable nature of blockchain technology minimizes the risk of fraud or manipulation, creating a more secure and reliable voting environment.
    How UniPoll Works:

Benefits for Voters:

-   Confidence in the integrity of their vote
-   Increased accessibility and convenience (potential for remote voting)
-   Reduced concerns about fraud or manipulation

Benefits for Election Officials:

-   Streamlined election administration
-   Increased trust in the electoral process
-   Reduced costs associated with traditional voting infrastructure

UniPoll: Ushering in a New Era of Secure and Transparent Elections.
By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, UniPoll promises a future where elections are secure, transparent, and accessible to all.

Like I explained in the about the project , unipoll is a web based platform.

-   So on the signup/signin interface we have a create poll and vote poll
    if you pick create poll you become an admin who creates a poll where you register candidates to be voted for and then you can monitor various things like who's winning and how many votes have been made and number of votes .

        <div align="center">
